## ⚡ Overview & Capabilities

**EvilTwin** is an advanced GKI 6.1 kernel build customized specifically for Qualcomm SM8635 devices (`peridot`). While standard OEM kernels stub or strip raw frame hooks, EvilTwin patches Qualcomm's `qcacld-3.0` WLAN architecture to unlock complete hardware access.

* **Native Monitor Mode:** Unlocks driver transport endpoints (`wlan0`), converting the network interface into a passive listener without external USB adapters.
* **Raw Frame Transmission:** Patches `ndo_start_xmit` hooks to transmit unencrypted 802.11 frames natively.
* **Integrated Root Stack:** Features KernelSU-Next / SukiSU-Ultra with full SUSFS v2.3.0 path, mount, and symbol hiding.
* **Native Container Support:** DroidSpaces / Rootless Docker support with namespacing preserved inside reserved KABI slots.

* **Root Integration:** SukiSU-Ultra / KernelSU-Next with real `KSU_VERSION` reporting.
* **Hiding Engine:** SUSFS v2.3.0 covering `sus_su`, mount points, open-redirect, and cmdline spoofing.
* **Telephony & IMS:** `DEBUG_INFO_BTF` remains enabled; full VoLTE, VoNR, and Netd functionality maintained without regressions.
